# The Cryptopals Crypto Challenges

This repo contains my solutions to [The Cryptopals Crypto Challenges](https://cryptopals.com/), a collection of exercises
for learning cryptography hands-on.

Files are named in this format: `s#c#_titleofexercise`. The first part before the underscore is the set/challenge number,
such as Set 1 Challenge 1 (challenges are grouped into sets based on topics). After the underscore is the title of the exercise,
which usually gives some hint of the kind of problem a challenge focuses on.
